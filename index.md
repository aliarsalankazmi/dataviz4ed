## The Problem of Data Visualization

- Data use is increasing rapidly within the education space
- Policymakers are under increasing pressure to use data to inform decisions, justify funding, and guide practice
- **But,** policymakers are often **not** statisticians, researchers, or quants
- **Data visualization** is a way to bridge this gap
- Proper data visualization will bring the data to the audience in a way they can understand quickly and use to inform decisions

---

## Chart Elements

There are a few things that all charts need. There are sometimes strong cases to deviate from these, but they are good rules of thumb. 

- **Axis labels** and a **title**
  * These make the chart self-explanatory
- A **legend**
  * What is the unit in the graphic?
- A **scale**
  * How are units mapped to the visual space
- **Annotations**
  * Author and data source (depending on distribution)

---

## Dimensions

- Charts and data are made up of dimensions (e.g. a bar chart is *x* and *y*)
- Additional dimensions can be represented by additional aesthetics or chart elements (e.g. color, size, shape, etc.)
- Dimensions can also be shown by multiple plots (e.g. a filmstrip)
- **Smart use of dimensions allows us to increase the information density of our charts**

## Data Types

- Any given dimension may be measured at different [levels of measure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement) [derived by Stanley Smith Stevens in the 1940s and 50s]
  * Nominal: unordered categories of data (e.g. race)
  * Ordinal: ordered categories of data, relative size and degree of difference between categories is unknown (e.g. Likert scales, proficiency levels perhaps)
  * Interval: ordered categories of data, fixed width, like discrete temperature scales (e.g. grade in school)
  * Continuous (ratio): a measurement scale in a continuous space with a meaningful zero - physical measurements (e.g. scale scores)

---

## Mapping Levels of Measure to Visual Cues

### Aesthetics for Mapping

How do we map levels of measurement onto visual features of charts?

Aesthetic |      Discrete              |  Continuous
----------|  ------------------------- | -------------------------------
Color     |  Disparate colors          |  Sequential or divergent colors
Size      |  Unique size for each value|   mapping to radius of value
Shape     |  A shape for each value    |   **does not make sense**

### Ordered vs. Unordered

Aesthetic  |    Ordered                         |  Unordered
---------- |  --------------------------------  |   -------------------------
Color      |  Sequential or divergent colors  |    Rainbow
Size       |  Increasing or decreasing radius |    **does not make sense**
Shape      |  **does not make sense**         |    A shape for each value


--- plot

## Example

<img src="figure/plot1.11.svg" title="plot of chunk plot1.1" alt="plot of chunk plot1.1" width="325px" height="245px" /><img src="figure/plot1.12.svg" title="plot of chunk plot1.1" alt="plot of chunk plot1.1" width="325px" height="245px" /><img src="figure/plot1.13.svg" title="plot of chunk plot1.1" alt="plot of chunk plot1.1" width="325px" height="245px" /><img src="figure/plot1.14.svg" title="plot of chunk plot1.1" alt="plot of chunk plot1.1" width="325px" height="245px" /><img src="figure/plot1.15.svg" title="plot of chunk plot1.1" alt="plot of chunk plot1.1" width="325px" height="245px" /><img src="figure/plot1.16.svg" title="plot of chunk plot1.1" alt="plot of chunk plot1.1" width="325px" height="245px" />

## Some tips

- Focus on the content
- Use best practices
- Understand the limitations
- Experiment and iterate!

## Examples

## Charting Categorical Data

<img src="figure/unnamed-chunk-3.svg" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" width="680px" height="480px" />


--- 

## Charting Ordinal Data

<img src="figure/unnamed-chunk-4.svg" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4" width="750px" height="550px" />


---

## Charting Interval/Continuous Data

<img src="figure/unnamed-chunk-5.svg" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" width="750px" height="550px" />


---

## Complexity

How do we display a ton of data--tens or hundreds of thousands of observations--with combinations of data types across multiple dimensions?

1. **Summarize the data**
  * Display summary statistics visually depicting the central tendency and spread of data
2. **Plot the raw data**
  * Annotate wisely to display the main message
3. **Model the data**
  * Use a statistical model to summarize features of the data

Let's look at some examples of this. 

--- 

## Summarizing Data

- The most simple summaries are measures of central tendency, most easily understood
- It is important to look at the spread of data too though
- If time is of interest, we are interested in trends
- If space is of interest, we are interested in maps or spatial distributions
- **Think about context and reference**
- Let's look at an example summarizing student data to schools!

## Plotting Means

Here is a simple plot of mean school reading scores:

<img src="figure/plotmeans.svg" title="plot of chunk plotmeans" alt="plot of chunk plotmeans" width="750px" height="500px" />


But, what's wrong with this plot?

--- &twocol w1:20% w2:80%

## Mistakes

*** left

>- No sense of scale
>- Means can be skewed
>- Simple means are not meaningful
>- With assessment scores we need to know grade distribution
>- Let's try to improve this

*** right

<img src="figure/plotmeanssmall.svg" title="plot of chunk plotmeanssmall" alt="plot of chunk plotmeanssmall" width="400px" height="325px" />


---

## Adding a Dimension

<img src="figure/meanplot2.svg" title="plot of chunk meanplot2" alt="plot of chunk meanplot2" width="750px" height="550px" />


--- 

## Even More Dimensions

<img src="figure/meanplot3.svg" title="plot of chunk meanplot3" alt="plot of chunk meanplot3" width="750px" height="550px" />


---

## Annotation

We still aren't sure what the mean scale score means. Let's see a couple more additions that can make this useful. 

<img src="figure/meanplot4.svg" title="plot of chunk meanplot4" alt="plot of chunk meanplot4" width="750px" height="480px" />


---

## Raw Data

Sometimes, we can get away with showing the raw data, that is, all data points. We may want to do this for a few reasons:

- the "wow" effect, 
- because it is easier, 
- or because it looks better aesthetically. 

How could it be done?

---

## 600,000 Observations Too Many

<img src="figure/rawdata1.png" title="plot of chunk rawdata1" alt="plot of chunk rawdata1" width="750px" height="550px" />


---

## Spread the Data Out

- Without reducing the data points we need to do three things to be successful

1. **Spread the data out**
  * These points overlap each other and make a mess
2. **Reduce the ink**
  * Each point has too much "weight"
3. **Add Reference Points**
  * 600,000 observations in one panel is not meaningful

>- Edward Tufte and others recommend **small multiples**, a technique of repeating a plot across groups to compare relationships in multiple dimensions

## What About This

<img src="figure/rawdata2.png" title="plot of chunk rawdata2" alt="plot of chunk rawdata2" width="750px" height="550px" />

## Even Smaller Multiples

## Illustrating a Model

<p align="center"><img src="img/withinstudentplot.png" height="490" width="750"></p>

---

## Combining Features

We can combine these features. 

>- Facets with smoother lines for references (small multiples + models)
>- Summary plots with raw data in the background
>- Reference lines and group comparisons

## Animation Example

<p align="center"><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1811289/TESTstuplot.gif" height="550" width="750"></p>

---

## Why does this work?

>- Annotation
>- Labeling
>- Lots of data-ink
>- Reference points galore

---
## Some tips

>- Have a properly chosen format and design 
>- Use words, numbers and drawing together
>- Reflect a balance, a proportion, relevant scale
>- Display an accessible complexity of details
>- Have a narrative quality, tell a story
>- Avoid content-free decoration (Tufte's proverbial chartjunk)
>- Draw in a professional manner with an eye on the technical details
>- Remember the map

--- plot

## Themes
They can **communicate**, **confound**, **brand**, and **distract**

<img src="figure/plot21.svg" title="plot of chunk plot2" alt="plot of chunk plot2" width="400px" height="220px" /><img src="figure/plot22.svg" title="plot of chunk plot2" alt="plot of chunk plot2" width="400px" height="220px" /><img src="figure/plot23.svg" title="plot of chunk plot2" alt="plot of chunk plot2" width="400px" height="220px" /><img src="figure/plot24.svg" title="plot of chunk plot2" alt="plot of chunk plot2" width="400px" height="220px" />

## Graphics Files

*** left

### Raster
- Files like **jpg** , **png** , **gif**. 
- Fixed scale, aspect ratio, and size
- Reasonable file size
- Viewable in almost any image viewing and editing system, including any modern web browser, PowerPoint, etc.

*** right

### Vector
- Files like **pdf** and **svg**
- Infinitely zoomable, adjustable on the fly
- Larger file size
- Viewable and usable in fewer systems. SVGs can be used in modern web browsers. PDFs included in other PDF reports. 

---

## Technologies

The technology you choose to do visualizations is largely a question of personal productivity, but with some important caveats:

- In the future, more and more content is going to be delivered in a paperless world, so pick a technology that can leverage web/tablet/phone interfaces
- Different technologies are useful for different levels of finish and polish; Adobe Illustrator is great for publication quality graphics, R is a great tool for rapidly prototyping different visualizations
- Chose a technology that best serves your **consumer**, not you are the producer. Charts are a service to the consumer, not to the creator. 

---

## Some Technologies

<img src="figure/technologies.svg" title="plot of chunk technologies" alt="plot of chunk technologies" width="750px" height="550px" />


---

## Programming vs. Illustrating

Keep in mind that depending on the project you may need to programatically make data visualizations, or you may need a highly customized illustrated graphic. 

---

## Beyond Graphics

We have a number of other techniques we can use beyond simple charts. 

- Animations
- Interactive demos
- Summary tables
- Videos
- Web sites
