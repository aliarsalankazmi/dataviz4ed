## The Problem of Data Visualization

- Data use is increasing rapidly within the education space
- Policymakers are under increasing pressure to use data to inform decisions, 
justify funding, and guide practice
- **But,** policymakers are often **not** statisticians, researchers, or quants
- **Data visualization** is a way to bridge this gap
- Proper data visualization will bring the data to the audience in a way they can understand quickly and use to inform decisions
